Teacher manuals should refer to topics (that is, a *.topic file inside /public/r/topic/ ).  
Make the directory structure and naming here in line with the naming in the topic directory,
so it is easy to find the manual that corresponds to a particular topic.  For instance, 
the manual for /public/r/topic/original_bjc/01-broadcast-animations-music.topic
should be /teacher/topic-manuals/original_bjc/01-broadcast-animations-music.html (or .pdf, .doc., etc)

If there are additional teacher resources specific to a topic, they can be included here.
However, if a resource is specific to a page or group of pages, consider putting them in the 
/teacher/resources/ directory (in a suitable sub-folder), since pages can get 
included many different topics.

Wouldn't it be nice to have a teachers manual for every single topic!  It sure would!
