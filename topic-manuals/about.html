   <h2>BJC Topic Manuals</h2>

<p>
Teacher manuals should refer to topics (that is, a *.topic file inside /public/r/topic/ ).  
Make the directory structure and naming here in line with the naming in the topic directory,
so it is easy to find the manual that corresponds to a particular topic.  For instance, 
the manual for /public/r/topic/original_bjc/01-broadcast-animations-music.topic
should be /teacher/topic-manuals/original_bjc/01-broadcast-animations-music.html (or .pdf, .doc., etc)
</p>
<p>
    If there are additional teacher resources specific to a topic, they can be included here.
However, if a resource is specific to a page or group of pages, consider putting them in the 
<a href="../activity-resources/">activity resources</a> directory (in a suitable sub-folder), since pages can get 
included many different topics.

</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have a teachers manual for every single topic!  It sure would!</p>

    a list of contents, and then use the specific file's http://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-teacher-resources/activity-resources/ URL.
