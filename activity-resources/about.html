   <h2>BJC Activity Resources</h2>

<p>
This area contains teacher resources specific to individual pages or groups of pages.  
(Since a page can be used in any number of topics, we don't include these page-specific
resources in <a href="../topic-manuals">the topic manuals area</a>.)
</p>

<p>(To see a automated listing of the content of this area, you can view the
    <a href=".">directory index</a> -- which will only work if you are 
    viewing this page from bjc.berkeley.edu.
    
    Unfortunately, if you are viewing via 
    <a href="http://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-teacher-resources">http://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-teacher-resources</a>, 
    you can't get a list of the contents 
    of this folder.  Yet.  You can go to the 
    <a href="https://github.com/beautyjoy/bjc-teacher-resources">repository view</a> to see
    a list of contents, and then use the specific file's http://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-teacher-resources/activity-resources/ URL.
