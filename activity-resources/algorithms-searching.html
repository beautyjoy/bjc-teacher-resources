Keep one set of sorted cups for yourself. Distribute the students' cups in a random, non-sequential order so that the students have no idea which cup is which. Designate one member of the group as the "leader," who will be responsible finding a particular cup with the help of his or her teammates.<br><br>This will simulate a standard data structure (array, linked list, etc) that doesn't use any sort of ordering to store its elements. The fastest way to search for a specific item is to scan the data structure iteratively, which is an O(n) operation.<br><h2>The Need for Speed</h2>Ask the students to brainstorm with their group to come up with a way of saving time of this type of operation. Allow them to use their set of cups to experiment and demonstrate any ideas that they have. Hopefully they will think of sorting the cups; if they haven't come up with this after a reasonable amount of time, feel free to nudge them in that direction or explain using your set of cups. If a group does develop this idea, have them demonstrate and explain it to the rest of the class after the other groups have had time to experiment.<br></body></html>
