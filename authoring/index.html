		<h1>Technical how-to for BJC Curriculum Authoring</h1>

		<p>
			The BJC curriculum is housed in a git repository
		</p>

		<h3>So you want to be a BJC author? Setting up GitHub</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Log in at <a href="github.com">github.com</a> (you can make an account for free).
			</li>
			<li>
				Point your browser to the central curriculum repository at <a href="https://github.com/beautyjoy/bjc-r">https://github.com/beautyjoy/bjc-r</a>, and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork</a> the repository by
				clicking on the 'fork' button at the upper right.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				(If you have
				enabled certain advanced features of GitHub, you may need to choose the context into which you
				fork the repo.  If you have just made your account, your fork will be immediately created).
			</li>
			<li>
				You will now have a clone of the central repository.  We can distinguish between these as:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b><i>YOUR-ACCT</i>/bjc-r</b> is your clone, to which you can do anything (delete files, etc).
						You can find it at <tt>http://github.com/YOUR-ACCT/bjc-r/</tt>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>beautyjoy/bjc-r</b> is the central repository.  You won't be able to write directly to
						this -- only managers can -- but you will be able to pull changes from it into your
						clone, and initiate a process that will integrate your clone's changes in it.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Authoring curriculum</h3>

		<p>
			This section deals with methods to author your clone of the BJC repository; for a more general introduction
			to the layout of the BJC materials repository and suggested workflows, see <a href="authoring.html">authoring.html</a>.
			There are two basic methods to make changes to your <b><i>YOUR-ACCT</i>/bjc-r</b> repository:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					Use the tools on <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a> to edit the files directly.
					This is a simple but comparitively limited method.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://github.com">github.com</a> has a fairly complete set of browser-based tools to edit,
					rename, etc., the files in the BJC repository.  Start at your repository's home page,
					which you can get to after logging in to github in the "Your Repositories" table along the right
					side.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Use the standard 'git' workflow to work with your clone.  You will be able to use the full
					power of git to author BJC materials; for novices to git, however, the learning curve can
					be quite steep.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Sharing your curriculum</h3>
